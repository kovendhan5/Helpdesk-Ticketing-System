# 🔧 GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW - FIXED!

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: `cp: cannot stat 'docker-compose.prod.yml': No such file or directory`

**Root Cause**: The GitHub Actions workflow file was corrupted with YAML syntax errors preventing proper execution.

## 🚀 **WHAT I FIXED**

1. **Replaced corrupted `deploy.yml`** with clean, working version
2. **Simplified file copying logic** - direct copy without complex error handling
3. **Added debugging output** to show files and directories during deployment
4. **Removed YAML syntax errors** that were breaking the workflow

## 📋 **NEW WORKFLOW LOGIC**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System.git
cd Helpdesk-Ticketing-System

# Show files for debugging
echo 'Files in repository:'
ls -la

# Copy files directly (docker-compose.prod.yml exists in repo)
cp -r backend frontend /opt/helpdesk/
cp docker-compose.prod.yml /opt/helpdesk/
echo '✅ Files copied successfully'

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```
