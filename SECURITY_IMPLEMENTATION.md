# Security Implementation Guide

## 🔒 **Security Improvements Implemented**

### 1. **Externalized Sensitive Secrets**

- ✅ Removed hardcoded `DB_PASSWORD` from docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Removed hardcoded `JWT_SECRET` from docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Added `REDIS_PASSWORD` to environment variables
- ✅ Configured environment variable substitution with secure defaults

### 2. **Configurable Deployment Settings**

- ✅ Externalized `FRONTEND_PORT` (no longer hardcoded to port 80)
- ✅ Externalized `API_URL` (no longer hardcoded to specific IP)
- ✅ Support for different environments via environment variables

### 3. **Safer Docker Operations**

- ✅ Removed global `docker container prune -f`
- ✅ Implemented targeted container cleanup for this application only
- ✅ Prevents accidental deletion of other applications' containers
- ✅ Non-root user for Nginx container (user:101)
- ✅ Non-root user for backend container (nodejs:1001)

### 4. **Enhanced API Security**

- ✅ Reduced login rate limit from 100 to 5 attempts
- ✅ Implemented Redis-backed token blacklist
- ✅ Added persistent session tracking across server restarts
- ✅ Tightened Content Security Policy in Nginx
- ✅ Added HSTS header for transport security

### 5. **Session & Token Management**

- ✅ Moved from in-memory token storage to Redis
- ✅ Implemented automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- ✅ Added fallback mechanisms for Redis unavailability
- ✅ Proper async token validation with error handling

### 6. **Infrastructure Improvements**

- ✅ Added Redis service for better security scaling
- ✅ Configured service dependencies correctly
- ✅ Added proper health checks for Redis
- ✅ Data persistence for Redis with volume

## 🔄 **Deployment Changes**

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- Updated workflow to include Redis password from secrets
- Added Redis dependency for backend service
- Updated health checks to include Redis

### Docker Compose

- Added Redis service with secure configuration
- Added Redis volume for data persistence
- Updated backend service to depend on Redis

### Application Code

- Added Redis service module with fallback mechanism
- Updated auth middleware to use Redis for token storage
- Modified session tracking to use Redis

## 📋 **Security Checklist**

- [x] Proper user permissions in containers
- [x] Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [x] Secure token storage and validation
- [x] Proper session management
- [x] Content Security Policy implementation
- [x] Input sanitization for all user inputs
- [x] Secure HTTP headers
- [x] Protection against brute force attacks
- [x] Database connection validation
- [x] Resource access controls

## 🛠️ **Future Security Recommendations**

1. Implement database encryption for sensitive fields
2. Add container vulnerability scanning to CI/CD pipeline
3. Set up security monitoring and alerting
4. Configure automatic backups for Redis and PostgreSQL
5. Conduct regular penetration testing
6. Implement HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
7. Add Web Application Firewall (WAF)
