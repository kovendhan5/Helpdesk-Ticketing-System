## 🔐 **STEP 2: Configure GitHub Secrets**

### **2.1 Navigate to GitHub Repository**
Go to: `https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/settings/secrets/actions`

### **2.2 Add Required Secrets**

| Secret Name | Source | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY** | Content of `terraform/helpdesk-key` file | SSH private key for VM access |
| **VM_IP** | Your GCP VM public IP | Target deployment server |
| **SLACK_WEBHOOK** | Your Slack webhook URL (optional) | Deployment notifications |

### **2.3 Get SSH Private Key Content**
```bash
# Display the private key content to copy
type terraform\helpdesk-key
```
**Copy the entire output** (including `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`)

### **2.4 Get VM IP Address**
```bash
# Get VM IP from Terraform output
cd terraform
terraform output vm_external_ip
```

---

## 🖥️ **STEP 3: Complete VM Setup (One-Time)**

### **3.1 SSH into Your VM**
```bash
ssh -i terraform/helpdesk-key ubuntu@YOUR_VM_IP
```

### **3.2 Run the Automated Setup Script**
```bash
# Download and run the setup commands
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/main/vm-setup-commands.sh | bash
```

**OR manually run the commands from `vm-setup-commands.sh`**

### **3.3 Complete PM2 Startup Configuration**
After running the setup script, you'll see a command like:
```bash
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu
```
**Run this command exactly as displayed**

### **3.4 Verify VM Setup**
```bash
# Check nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Check PM2 status  
pm2 status

# Verify environment file
cat /opt/helpdesk/.env
```

---

## 🧪 **STEP 4: Test Automated Deployment**

### **4.1 Trigger First Deployment**
The deployment will automatically trigger when you push to the `main` branch. You can also:

1. **Manual Trigger**: Go to GitHub Actions tab and manually run the workflow
2. **Push a Change**: Make any small change and push to trigger deployment

### **4.2 Monitor Deployment**
Watch the deployment progress at:
`https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/actions`

**Expected deployment stages:**
1. 🧪 **Test Stage** (~2-3 minutes)
   - Backend linting and testing
   - Frontend testing and building
   - Security audit

2. 🏗️ **Build Stage** (~1-2 minutes)  
   - Production React build
   - Artifact creation and upload

3. 🚀 **Deploy Stage** (~2-3 minutes)
   - SSH connection to VM
   - Code deployment
   - PM2 process restart
   - Health checks

4. ✅ **Verify Stage** (~30 seconds)
   - Application health verification
   - Deployment success confirmation

---

## 🎉 **STEP 5: Verify Production Deployment**

### **5.1 Check Application Status**
```bash
# Visit your application
curl http://YOUR_VM_IP

# Check backend API
curl http://YOUR_VM_IP/api/health

# Check frontend
curl -I http://YOUR_VM_IP
```

### **5.2 Monitor Application Logs**
```bash
# SSH into VM
ssh -i terraform/helpdesk-key ubuntu@YOUR_VM_IP

# Check PM2 logs
pm2 logs

# Check nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

---

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **Rollback to Previous Version**
```bash
# SSH into VM
ssh -i terraform/helpdesk-key ubuntu@YOUR_VM_IP

# Restore from backup
sudo cp -r /opt/helpdesk-backup/* /opt/helpdesk/
pm2 restart all
```

### **Manual Deployment (if CI/CD fails)**
```bash
# SSH into VM
ssh -i terraform/helpdesk-key ubuntu@YOUR_VM_IP

# Manual deployment
cd /opt/helpdesk
git pull origin main
npm install --production
npm run build
pm2 restart all
```

---

## 📞 **SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **SSH Connection Failed**: Check SSH_PRIVATE_KEY format and VM_IP accuracy
2. **Build Failures**: Check test failures in GitHub Actions logs
3. **PM2 Issues**: Verify PM2 startup was configured correctly
4. **Nginx Issues**: Check nginx configuration and restart service

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check CI/CD pipeline status
git log --oneline -5

# Verify GitHub secrets are set
# (Check in GitHub repository settings)

# Test SSH connection manually
ssh -i terraform/helpdesk-key ubuntu@YOUR_VM_IP "echo 'Connection successful'"
```

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
- ✅ Application responds at `http://YOUR_VM_IP`
- ✅ API endpoints return expected responses  
- ✅ PM2 shows running processes
- ✅ Nginx serves static files correctly

---

## 🎯 **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT**

After completing these steps:
1. **Every push to `main`** triggers automated deployment
2. **Failed deployments** automatically rollback
3. **Slack notifications** keep you informed (if configured)
4. **Zero-downtime** deployments ensure continuous availability
5. **Health checks** verify application status after each deployment

**🎉 Congratulations! Your professional CI/CD pipeline is now live!**
