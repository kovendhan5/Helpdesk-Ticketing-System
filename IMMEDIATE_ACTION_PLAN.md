# ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - SSH Authentication Fix

## âœ… Problem Identified & Fixed

**Issue**: GitHub Actions was trying to authenticate as 'ubuntu' instead of 'kovendhan2535'
**Solution**: Fixed all workflow files to use proper `${{ secrets.VM_USER }}` variable

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Do These Now):

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. **Go to GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System
2. **Navigate to Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. **Add/Update these 3 secrets**:

   **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**:

   - Get content from VM: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
   - Copy the ENTIRE output (including BEGIN/END lines)

   **VM_HOST**:

   - Set to: `34.173.186.108`

   **VM_USER**:

   - Set to: `kovendhan2535` (NOT ubuntu!)

### Step 2: Test Deployment

1. **Go to Actions tab** in GitHub
2. **Click "ðŸš€ Deploy Helpdesk System"**
3. **Click "Run workflow"** â†’ **"Run workflow"**
4. **Watch the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   ðŸ§ª Testing SSH connection to kovendhan2535@34.173.186.108...
   SSH connection successful!
   ```

### Step 3: If Still Shows 'ubuntu' in Logs

- The VM_USER secret is wrong - make sure it's set to `kovendhan2535`

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Success Flow:

1. âœ… SSH connects as kovendhan2535 (not ubuntu)
2. âœ… Docker containers are built and started
3. âœ… Application accessible at http://34.173.186.108:3001

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong:

- Check the `GITHUB_SECRETS_FIX.md` file for detailed troubleshooting
- The main issue was hardcoded 'ubuntu' references - this is now fixed

**The code is ready, the workflows are fixed - you just need to set the GitHub Secrets correctly!**
