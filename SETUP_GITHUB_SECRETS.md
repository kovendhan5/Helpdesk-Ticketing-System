# 🔧 GitHub Secrets Setup - Step by Step Guide

## ✅ Good News!

The workflow is now working correctly! It's properly checking for secrets and telling us exactly what's missing.

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Get SSH Private Key from VM

You need to get the SSH private key from your VM. Since you can only access via Google Cloud Console:

1. **Open Google Cloud Console** in your browser
2. **Navigate to your VM** (helpdesk-vm)
3. **Click "SSH"** button to open browser SSH terminal
4. **Run this command to get your private key**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
5. **Copy the ENTIRE output** (should start with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`)

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Secrets

1. **Open your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System
2. **Click "Settings"** tab (top of repo)
3. **Click "Secrets and variables"** → **"Actions"** (left sidebar)
4. **Click "New repository secret"**

### Step 3: Add Required Secrets

**Secret 1: SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**

- Name: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Value: Paste the entire output from `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (including BEGIN/END lines)

**Secret 2: VM_HOST**

- Name: `VM_HOST`
- Value: `34.173.186.108`

**Secret 3: VM_USER**

- Name: `VM_USER`
- Value: `kovendhan2535`

### Step 4: Verify Secrets Are Set

After adding all 3 secrets, you should see them listed in the Secrets page:

- ✅ SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
- ✅ VM_HOST
- ✅ VM_USER

### Step 5: Run Deployment Again

1. **Go to "Actions"** tab in GitHub
2. **Click "🚀 Deploy Helpdesk System"** workflow
3. **Click "Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"**
4. **Watch the logs** - should now show:
   ```
   🔍 Validating GitHub Secrets...
   ✅ All required secrets are configured
   🧪 Testing SSH connection to kovendhan2535@34.173.186.108...
   SSH connection successful!
   ```

## 🔥 Expected Success Flow

1. ✅ Secrets validation passes
2. ✅ SSH connects as kovendhan2535
3. ✅ Docker containers build and start
4. ✅ Application live at http://34.173.186.108:3001

## 📝 Notes

- The private key should include the header/footer lines
- VM_USER must be exactly `kovendhan2535` (not ubuntu)
- VM_HOST must be exactly `34.173.186.108`

**The workflow is fixed and ready - just need to configure the secrets!**
