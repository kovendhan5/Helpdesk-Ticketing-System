# NEW DEPLOYMENT PLAN - Port 8080 Strategy

## Problem Analysis

- Persistent port 80 conflicts preventing frontend deployment
- Complex port-freeing logic hasn't resolved the issue
- Need a simpler, more reliable approach

## Solution

**Switch from port 80 to port 8080** - This avoids the conflict entirely and simplifies deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)

- Changed frontend port mapping from `${FRONTEND_PORT:-80}:80` to `${FRONTEND_PORT:-8080}:80`
- This maps external port 8080 to internal container port 80

### 2. GitHub Actions Deployment (`deploy.yml`)

- Updated environment variable: `FRONTEND_PORT=8080`
- Removed all complex port 80 freeing logic (sudo commands, fuser, etc.)
- Simplified deployment script
- Updated health checks to test `http://localhost:8080/`

### 3. Monitoring Script (`monitor-deployment.bat`)

- Updated to check `http://34.173.186.108:8080` instead of port 80
- Updated success message to show correct URL

## Deployment Process

1. **Build**: Both frontend and backend should build successfully (this was working)
2. **Start**: All containers should start without port conflicts
3. **Access**: Frontend will be available at `http://34.173.186.108:8080`
4. **Monitor**: Use `monitor-deployment.bat` to track deployment progress

## Expected Outcome

- ✅ No more port 80 conflicts
- ✅ Simplified deployment process
- ✅ Frontend accessible at http://34.173.186.108:8080
- ✅ Backend accessible at http://34.173.186.108:3001

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes
2. Trigger GitHub Actions deployment
3. Monitor with `monitor-deployment.bat`
4. Verify full functionality once deployed

## Fallback Plan

If port 8080 also has conflicts, we can easily change to:

- Port 8081, 8082, or any other available port
- The same approach will work with any port number
