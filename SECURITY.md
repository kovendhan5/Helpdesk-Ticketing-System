## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to the project maintainers. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiry
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Password strength validation
- Session management with timeout controls
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Input Security
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection via security headers
- CSRF token support
- Request size and timeout limits

### Network Security
- CORS protection with configurable origins
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- API versioning support
- Request/response validation

### Container Security
- Non-root user containers
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- Minimal base images
- Security context constraints
- No unnecessary capabilities

### Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Rate limiting monitoring
- Intrusion detection patterns
- Real-time security monitoring

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are properly configured:

```bash
# JWT Configuration (required)
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key-at-least-32-characters-long
JWT_EXPIRY=1h

# Database Security
DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-database-password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-database-password

# Application Security
NODE_ENV=production
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Security Features
SECURITY_MONITORING=true
INTRUSION_DETECTION=true
LOG_SECURITY_EVENTS=true
```

### Docker Security

- Containers run as non-root users
- Read-only root filesystem implemented
- Security options configured:
  - `no-new-privileges:true`
  - `apparmor:docker-default`
- Capabilities dropped and minimal privileges
- Resource limits enforced

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment:

- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Scan for known vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Verify environment configuration
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Validate input sanitization works
- [ ] Check rate limiting is effective
- [ ] Verify HTTPS configuration
- [ ] Review and test security headers
- [ ] Validate CORS configuration
- [ ] Test container security settings

### Production Security:

- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Backup encryption enabled
- [ ] Log monitoring and retention
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented

### Regular Maintenance:

- [ ] Monthly dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security audits
- [ ] Regular penetration testing
- [ ] Security log reviews
- [ ] Access control reviews
- [ ] Backup and recovery testing

## Security Features in Detail

### Rate Limiting
- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- API requests: 100 per 15 minutes
- Registration: 50 per hour
- Emergency mode available

### Session Management
- JWT tokens with configurable expiry
- Session timeout controls
- Concurrent session limits
- Secure cookie settings

### Intrusion Detection
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS attempt monitoring
- Suspicious request tracking
- Automated blocking of malicious IPs

### Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security enabled
- Content-Security-Policy configured
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Run incident response script: `./incident-response.bat`
   - Document the incident details
   - Assess the scope and impact

2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary
   - Apply emergency rate limiting
   - Block malicious IPs or patterns

3. **Investigation**:
   - Review security logs
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Identify compromised data/systems

4. **Recovery**:
   - Apply security patches
   - Reset credentials if compromised
   - Restore from clean backups if needed

5. **Follow-up**:
   - Update security measures
   - Conduct lessons learned session
   - Update incident response procedures

## Security Tools and Scripts

The project includes several security tools:

- `./security-monitor.bat` - Real-time security monitoring
- `./security-audit.bat` - Comprehensive security audit
- `./incident-response.bat` - Emergency response procedures
- `./advanced-security-hardening.bat` - Apply additional security measures
- `./quick-security-check.bat` - Quick security status check

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Issues**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
- **General Questions**: Open a public issue with the `security` label
