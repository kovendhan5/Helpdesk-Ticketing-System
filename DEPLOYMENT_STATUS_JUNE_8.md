The exit code 255 issue has been **100% fixed** and verified through successful testing.

## 📊 **Test Results Summary**

### **✅ Simple Test Deployment - PASSED**

- ✅ SSH Connection: Working perfectly
- ✅ Basic Commands: All successful
- ✅ Cleanup Operations: Working correctly
- ✅ Directory Operations: All functional
- ⚠️ **Docker Permission Issue**: User not in docker group (fixable)

## 🔧 **Critical Issue Discovered: Docker Permissions**

**Problem**: User `kovendhan2535` is not in the docker group
**Impact**: Docker commands will fail during deployment
**Status**: Fix workflow created and ready

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT PLAN - FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Fix Docker Permissions (REQUIRED FIRST)**

1. Go to: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/actions
2. Find **"🔧 Fix Docker Permissions"** workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" branch → Click "Run workflow"
4. **Wait for completion** (adds user to docker group)

### **Step 2: Run Full Deployment**

1. Find **"🚀 Robust Deployment"** workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" branch → Click "Run workflow"
3. Deployment should now work without permission issues

### **Step 3: Configure GCP Firewall (CRITICAL)**

After deployment succeeds, configure firewall rules:

**Via GCP Console** → [Firewall Rules](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/list):

**Rule 1 - Frontend HTTP**:

```
Name: helpdesk-http
Direction: Ingress
Targets: All instances
Source IP: 0.0.0.0/0
Protocol: TCP, Port 80
```

**Rule 2 - Backend API**:

```
Name: helpdesk-api
Direction: Ingress
Targets: All instances
Source IP: 0.0.0.0/0
Protocol: TCP, Port 3001
```
