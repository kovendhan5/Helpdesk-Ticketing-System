=== SUDO PERMISSION FIX DEPLOYED ===
Time: $(date)

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- VM user 'kovendhan2535' cannot run sudo commands in SSH session
- GitHub Actions deployment failing with "sudo: a terminal is required to read the password"
- All Docker commands were using sudo, causing deployment failure

SOLUTION DEPLOYED:
✅ Created no-sudo-deploy.yml - Comprehensive deployment without sudo
✅ Created simple-deploy.yml - Minimal deployment for quick restarts  
✅ Created setup-docker-user.sh - One-time VM setup script

CRITICAL: VM SETUP REQUIRED
To fix the deployment permanently, run this ONCE on the VM:

1. SSH into the VM:
   ssh kovendhan2535@34.173.186.108

2. Run the setup script:
   cd /home/kovendhan2535/helpdesk
   chmod +x setup-docker-user.sh
   ./setup-docker-user.sh

3. Log out and log back in, or run:
   newgrp docker

4. Test docker without sudo:
   docker ps

ALTERNATIVE QUICK FIX:
If you can access the VM via Google Cloud Console:

1. Open Cloud Console
2. Go to Compute Engine > VM instances  
3. Click SSH button for helpdesk-vm
4. Run: sudo usermod -aG docker kovendhan2535
5. Run: newgrp docker
6. Test: docker ps

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- New workflows pushed to GitHub
- Emergency-deploy.yml (with sudo) - will still fail
- Simple-deploy.yml (no sudo) - will work after VM setup
- No-sudo-deploy.yml (comprehensive) - will work after VM setup

NEXT STEPS:
1. Setup VM docker group membership (see above)
2. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful deployment
3. Test application at http://34.173.186.108

MONITORING:
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/actions
- Application: http://34.173.186.108
- Backend API: http://34.173.186.108:3001/health
