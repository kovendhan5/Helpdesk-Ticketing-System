1. SIMPLE-DEPLOY.YML (Recommended)
   - No sudo required
   - Fast deployment (5 minutes)
   - Automatic on git push
   - Status: ACTIVE

2. NO-SUDO-DEPLOY.YML (Comprehensive)
   - Includes docker group setup
   - Health checks and validation
   - 7-minute timeout
   - Status: READY

3. MANUAL-DEPLOY.SH (Emergency)
   - Direct VM execution
   - Complete control
   - No GitHub Actions dependency
   - Status: READY

CRITICAL VM SETUP REQUIRED:
The VM user 'kovendhan2535' must be added to the docker group to run Docker without sudo.

QUICK SETUP METHODS:

Method 1 - Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to Compute Engine > VM instances
2. Click SSH for helpdesk-vm
3. Run: sudo usermod -aG docker kovendhan2535
4. Run: newgrp docker
5. Test: docker ps

Method 2 - Use setup script:
1. SSH to VM: ssh kovendhan2535@34.173.186.108
2. cd /home/kovendhan2535/helpdesk
3. chmod +x setup-docker-user.sh
4. ./setup-docker-user.sh

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/actions

3. Test backend: http://34.173.186.108:3001/health
4. Login with: admin@example.com / admin123

CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- Code pushed successfully
- Workflows triggered
- Waiting for VM docker group setup
- Ready for immediate deployment once VM is configured

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Configure VM docker group (5 minutes)
2. Monitor deployment success
3. Verify application functionality
4. Production ready!
