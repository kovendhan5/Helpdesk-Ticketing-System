🚨 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT INITIATED - JUNE 8, 2025
================================================================

🔥 PROBLEM: Deployment stuck for 1.5 hours (unacceptable!)

✅ EMERGENCY SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Removed all conflicting Docker files
- Created ultra-simple 2-minute deployment  
- Force-kills all hanging processes
- Uses existing frontend build (no rebuild needed)
- Simple backend with Node 18 (stable)
- Added health checks and timeouts
- 5-minute maximum deployment time

📊 WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW:
1. GitHub Actions is force-killing ALL containers on VM
2. Cleaning up all Docker resources  
3. Fresh git clone (no cache issues)
4. Building only backend (frontend uses existing build)
5. Starting all containers with health checks

⏱️ EXPECTED COMPLETION: 2-3 minutes (not hours!)
