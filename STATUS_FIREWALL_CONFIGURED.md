# 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STATUS - FIREWALL CONFIGURED! - June 8, 2025

## 🎉 MAJOR UPDATE: FIREWALL RULES CONFIGURED!

### ✅ FIREWALL STATUS: READY!

**Excellent news!** The GCP firewall rules are already properly configured:

- **✅ helpdesk-firewall**: Allows TCP ports 22, 80, 3001 from 0.0.0.0/0
- **✅ helpdesk-http-traffic**: Allows TCP ports 22, 80, 3001 from 0.0.0.0/0

**🔥 This means ALL required ports are open and accessible:**

- ✅ Port 22 (SSH)
- ✅ Port 80 (Frontend HTTP)
- ✅ Port 3001 (Backend API + WebSocket)

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (SIMPLIFIED)

### 1. ⏳ Monitor Deployment Completion

**ONLY remaining step**: Wait for GitHub Actions deployment to finish

**📍 Monitor At**: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/actions

### 2. 🧪 Test System Access (Expected in 5-10 minutes)

Once deployment completes, test:

- **Frontend**: http://34.173.186.108
- **Backend Health**: http://34.173.186.108:3001/health
- **API**: http://34.173.186.108:3001/api

## 📋 BROWSER WINDOWS OPENED

I've opened the following for monitoring/testing:

1. **Frontend**: http://34.173.186.108
2. **Backend Health**: http://34.173.186.108:3001/health
3. **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/kovendhan5/Helpdesk-Ticketing-System/actions
