❌ docker-compose.simple.yml missing from cloned repository

🛠️ EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS DEPLOYED:

1. ROBUST-DEPLOY.YML (Comprehensive Solution):
   ✅ Multiple git clone strategies (normal, shallow, manual)
   ✅ Automatic fallback to manual file creation
   ✅ Self-contained docker-compose.simple.yml generation
   ✅ Basic backend and frontend creation

2. EMERGENCY-MANUAL-DEPLOY.SH (Direct VM Solution):
   ✅ Complete manual deployment script
   ✅ Creates all required files from scratch
   ✅ Beautiful landing page frontend
   ✅ Functional backend with health checks
   ✅ Can be run directly on VM if GitHub Actions fails

🎯 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES:

Strategy 1: GitHub Actions (Automated)
- robust-deploy.yml now running
- Handles git failures automatically
- Creates minimal working system

Strategy 2: Manual VM Deployment (Backup)
- Copy emergency-manual-deploy.sh to VM
- Run directly: chmod +x deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh
- Bypasses all git and GitHub issues

🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
